circuit breakers
pattern to prevent "cascading failure"
request filter

Cascading Failure :- Cascading failure is a where the failure of one part of an interconnected system results in the failure of more parts, and eventually the whole system. 
		example:- 	request ------> Order Service ----HTTP----> Payment Service
					For each request a thread will be assigned from servlet thread pool
					
		Immediate Failure --> Connection refused by Payment service as it is down
		Timeout Failures ---> Payment service took long time to send a response
		
		If we have a system wheer lot of services are talking with each other and then this can cause problem to many services and bring thr applivation down



Circuit Breakers :- Circuit Breakers pattern ensures stable performance in your microservices by monitoring for failures and providing an alternate service or error message.
		example:- 	request ------> Order Service ----HTTP----> Payment Service
					For each request a thread will be assigned from servlet thread pool
					
		Immediate Failure --> Connection refused by Payment service as it is down
		Timeout Failures ---> Payment service took long time to send a response
		
		If we have a system wheer lot of services are talking with each other and then this can cause problem to many services and bring thr applivation down

Request Interceptor :- To avoid this use request interceptor to pass all services through this through 

	Different States of the Circuit Breaker
		The circuit breaker has three distinct states: Closed, Open, and Half-Open:
		1. Closed – When everything is normal, the circuit breaker remains in the closed state and all calls pass through to the services. When the number of failures exceeds a 	 predetermined threshold the breaker trips, and it goes into the Open state.
		2. Open – The  circuit breaker returns an error for calls without executing the function.
		3. Half-Open – After a timeout period, the circuit switches to a half-open state to test if the underlying problem still exists. If a single call fails in this half-open state, the breaker is once again tripped. If it succeeds, the circuit breaker resets back to the normal, closed state. 
			
			
	Two projects that implements Circuit Breakers
	1. Hystrix
	2. Resillience project
