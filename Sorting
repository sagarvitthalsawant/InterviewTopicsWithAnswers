Sorting Algorithm
	
Bubble Sort :-
	Bubble sort works by iterating first element to last element, comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in correct order.
	Each iteration places next larger value to its correct place.
	
Quick Sort :-
	It a sorting algorithm, which is using divide and conquer algorithm.
	Lets say array is arr[]
	Choose a pivot, it is generally mid element of the list.
	Initialise two index variable , left=0 and right=arr.length-1
	Increment left variable until you get element higher than pivot.
	Decrement right variable until you get element lesser than pivot
	swap arr[left] and arr[right]
	Recursively sort sublists(sublist with less than pivot, sublist greater than pivot) using above algorithm.
	In the end , you will get sorted array.
	
Merge Sort :-
	Merge sort Algorithm
    It works on below principle:
    Divide list into sublist of about half size in each iteration until each sublist has only one element.
    Merge each sublist repeatedly to create sorted list. It will run until we have only 1 sorted list.
    This will be the sorted list.
	
Selection :-
	Selection sort is an in place comparison sorting algorithm.
	It is very simple to implement but it does not go well with large number of inputs.
	Selection sort algorithm
	Find the minimum element in the list.
	Swap minimum element with current element.
	Repeat the whole process until array is fully sorted.
	
Heap Sort :-	
	A heap is a tree with some special properties,
	so value of node should be greater than or equal to(less than or equal to in case of min heap)
	children of the node and tree should be complete binary tree.
